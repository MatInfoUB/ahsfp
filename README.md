# Deep Learning based Prediction of Perovskite Lattice Parameters from Hirshfeld Surface Fingerprints

This software package takes an arbitary crystal structure to predict material properties.

##### Prerequisites

Pandas
Keras (with Tensorflow 1.8.0)
Scikit-Learn

##### How to use:

######TODO

Training the model

######Using a pre-trained model:

Download the package using the following code:

`git clone https://github.com/arpanisi/mof_single_atom_hs.git`

Use conda to create an environment as:

`conda create -n mofpy python=3.7 scikit-learn keras tensorflow`

This creates a conda environment along with installing the prerequisites. Activate the environemnt by:

`conda activate mofpy`

Navigate to the folder `/mof_single_atom_hs` and type:

`python predict.py`
